I am a Ph.D. Student in Statistics at the **University of Pittsburgh**, expecting to graduate in 2027. I am also an **Andrew W. Mellon Predoctoral Fellow** (2025-2026).

Previously, I obtained my M.S. in Statistical Practice from **Carnegie Mellon University** and my B.S. in Statistics from **SUSTech**.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **Bayesian Statistics**, **Statistical Genomics**, and **Machine Learning**. 

I am particularly interested in developing rigorous statistical frameworks for **cell-free DNA (cfDNA)** analysis to advance non-invasive disease diagnostics. My work involves constructing novel probabilistic models (e.g., Bayesian tree-based models, spatial probit models) and implementing high-performance computing algorithms in **C++ and R**.
